# Area Calculator for Geometrical Shapes

# Geometric Shapes And Functions Area Calculator

This C program allows users to calculate the area of various geometric shapes, including circles, squares, rectangles, trapeziums, triangles, parallelograms, and cones. Additionally, it provides the option to find the area under a user-defined mathematical function using Riemann sums.


# Supported Shapes:

Circle

Square

Rectangle

Trapezium

Triangle

Parallelogram

Cone

Sphere

Square pyramid

Ellipse

Regular polygon

Cylinder

Cube or cuboid


# Example Usage:

For a circle, enter the radius when prompted.

For a square, enter the side length.

For a rectangle, enter both the shorter and longer side lengths.

For a trapezium, enter the shorter parallel side, longer parallel side, and height.

For a triangle, enter the lengths of the three sides.

For a parallelogram, enter the base and height.

For a regular polygon, enter the number of sides.

For a cone, enter radius, height and slant height.

For a sphere, enter the radius.

For a cube or cuboid, enter length, breadth, and height.

For a cylinder, enter radius and height.

For a ellipse, enter the length of minor and major axis.

For a square pyramid, enter the length of base, height, and slant perpendicular length.


# Function Definitions

The code begins with the definition of several functions, each responsible for printing a particular geometric shape:-

circle(), rectangle(), square(), triangle(), parallelogram(), trapezium(), Ellipse(), cone(), cube_or_cuboid(), cylinder(), square_pyramid(), sphere(): These

functions calculate the area of the 2D shapes and print certain shape sand for 3D shapes to print volume and total surface area.


# Main Function:

The main() function is the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to choose the shape.

If the user chooses the code fot the geometric shape whose area he wants to find:

The program prompts for relevant dimensions.

The corresponding shape function is called to calculate and display the area.

For some cases the shape is printed and for some case the volumes of the selected 3D shape is also printed.
